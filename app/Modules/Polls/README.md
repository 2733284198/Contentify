- Polls can be "internal", so only logged in members of your organisation are able to see these polls and participate in them
- Polls have one of two states: Open and closed. Only if a poll is open, users are able to vote.
- Only logged in users are able to vote. This ensures a person can only participate once per poll.
- If you limit the votes per user per poll to 1 radio buttons w ill be showed (so only one can be selected). 
If you limit it to a number greater than 1, check boxes will be displayed.
- You may add up to 15 voting options to each poll
- Results of the polls will be cached to increase performance
